# Project Highlights
- Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled numerical features.

- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized distributions and correlations to uncover patterns influencing subscription behavior.

- Modeling: Implemented various classification algorithms such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines.

- Evaluation: Assessed model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC metrics.

# Key Findings
- Influential Factors: Job type, education level, and previous contact outcome significantly impact subscription likelihood.

- Optimal Timing: Campaigns conducted in May and June yielded higher subscription rates.

- Model Performance: Achieved an accuracy of 100 using RandomForestClassifier
